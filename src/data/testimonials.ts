        text: 'I was so anxious about getting lip fillers for the first time — I had this fear of looking "done". Elena spent a full 20 minutes just talking through my face shape and what I actually wanted. The result is so natural that even my mum noticed something looked different but couldn\'t quite place what it was. That\'s exactly what I wanted.',

        text: 'I\'ve been for anti-wrinkle injections twice now and both experiences have been exceptional. The clinic itself is beautiful and calming — nothing clinical or intimidating about it. I look refreshed and well-rested, not frozen. My colleagues keep asking what I\'ve changed about my skincare.',

        text: 'What sets Lumière apart is the honesty. During my consultation Elena actually talked me out of a treatment I thought I wanted — she said it wouldn\'t give me the results I was after, and recommended Profhilo instead. That integrity means everything. My skin has been glowing for three months.',

        text: 'After a bad experience elsewhere, I was hesitant to try fillers again. A friend referred me to Elena and I\'m so grateful — she assessed my previous filler, gave me honest advice about dissolving it first, then when the time was right we worked on a completely new plan. The care is genuinely second to none.',
