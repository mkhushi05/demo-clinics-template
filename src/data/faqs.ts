        question: 'Do I need a consultation before treatment?',
        answer:
            'Yes — and we consider this non-negotiable. As a medically-led clinic, a face-to-face consultation is required before any injectable treatment. This gives us the opportunity to understand your goals, assess your anatomy and medical history, discuss risks and realistic outcomes, and ensure you\'re a suitable candidate. Consultations at Lumière are always complimentary.',

        question: 'What should I do to prepare for my treatment?',
        answer:
            'For dermal fillers: avoid alcohol for 24 hours beforehand and, if possible, avoid blood-thinning medications like ibuprofen or aspirin (unless prescribed) for 48 hours, as these increase bruising risk. Arrive with clean skin — no heavy makeup needed. For anti-wrinkle injections: no special preparation is required. Arrive makeup-free if possible for the treatment area.',

        question: 'What is the minimum age for treatment?',
        answer:
            'We strictly do not treat anyone under 18. This is both a legal requirement under UK law and our own clinical and ethical position. We operate a Challenge 25 policy — you will be asked to provide valid photo identification (passport or driving licence) if you appear to be under 25.',

        category: 'Treatments & Results',
        question: 'Are aesthetic treatments painful?',
        answer:
            'We prioritise your comfort. A high-strength clinical-grade topical numbing cream is applied before filler procedures and left for 20–30 minutes. Many of the premium fillers we use also contain the local anaesthetic lidocaine within the product itself. Anti-wrinkle injections are administered with an ultra-fine needle and most patients rate the discomfort at 2–3 out of 10 — comparable to a light pinch.',

        category: 'Treatments & Results',
        question: 'Will I look overdone or unnatural?',
        answer:
            'Our entire approach is built around natural-looking results. We dose conservatively, assess carefully, and believe that the best aesthetic outcome is one that can\'t be identified. If Elena believes a treatment won\'t achieve a natural result for your anatomy, she will tell you — and will often suggest an alternative. We have a strict "no overfilling" policy.',

        category: 'Treatments & Results',
        question: 'How long do results last?',
        answer:
            'It varies by treatment. Lip fillers typically last 6–12 months depending on your metabolism and lifestyle. Anti-wrinkle injections last 3–4 months on average. Profhilo skin booster results last up to 6 months. Your complimentary follow-up appointment will assess results and discuss next steps.',

        category: 'Treatments & Results',
        question: 'Can lip fillers be reversed?',
        answer:
            'Yes. Hyaluronic acid fillers — the type we exclusively use — are fully reversible using a medical enzyme called hyaluronidase. In the rare event you\'re unhappy with a result, or if we ever need to dissolve product for medical reasons, this can be done safely. We offer dissolving treatment from £150.',

Elena is a qualified Independent Nurse Prescriber (INP) registered with the NMC, holds an advanced Level 7 Post-Graduate Diploma in Clinical Aesthetics, and is certified in complications management.
